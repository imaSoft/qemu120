bluetooth fix:
===============

Bootup errors are:

Bluetooth: Patch file not found ar3k/AthrBT_0x11020000.dfu
Bluetooth: Loading patch file failed

and after bootup the Bluetooth icon is no longer illuminated in the top bar on Unity

Apparently, since at least January, they've been shipping the mainboard in the 
C710-2847 that was just announced in the new model that is $80 more expensive 
(but comes with an extra 2GB RAM and larger battery). Those new features 
are USB3, Bluetooth3, etc.


It turns out this is a bug in Ubuntu 12.04 (#1024884) which the ChrUbuntu guys 
apparently worked around but which is reset when reloading the fresh kernel 
with this script. After your script runs, Bluetooth can be restored by 
doing this in a Terminal window:

user@ChrUbuntu~$ cd /lib/firmware/ar3k
user@ChrUbuntu~$ sudo wget https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1024884/+attachment/3244421/+files/AthrBT_0x11020000.dfu
Password:
user@ChrUbuntu~$ sudo wget https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1024884/+attachment/3244422/+files/ramps_0x11020000_40.dfu
user@ChrUbuntu~$ sudo reboot

After the system comes back, you'll find the Bluetooth icon illuminated 
again in the top bar on Unity and/or you can go to the Bluetooth panel 
in the System Settings. Some models of C7 might not have the AR3K chip 
so these directions might not do anything useful (but shouldn't hurt). 
Hopefully they can be incorporated into the above script.


backlight fix for kernel 3.8:
===============================

see the patch file.
