It turns out this is a bug in Ubuntu 12.04 (#1024884) which the ChrUbuntu guys apparently worked around but which is reset when reloading the fresh kernel with this script. After your script runs, Bluetooth can be restored by doing this in a Terminal window:

user@ChrUbuntu~$ cd /lib/firmware/ar3k
user@ChrUbuntu~$ sudo wget https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1024884/+attachment/3244421/+files/AthrBT_0x11020000.dfu
Password:
user@ChrUbuntu~$ sudo wget https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1024884/+attachment/3244422/+files/ramps_0x11020000_40.dfu
user@ChrUbuntu~$ sudo reboot

After the system comes back, you'll find the Bluetooth icon illuminated again in the top bar on Unity and/or you can go to the Bluetooth panel in the System Settings. Some models of C7 might not have the AR3K chip so these directions might not do anything useful (but shouldn't hurt). Hopefully they can be incorporated into the above script.
