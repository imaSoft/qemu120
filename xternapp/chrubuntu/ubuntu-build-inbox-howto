This is all from Redditer michaela_elise. (Thank you!)

There is a script that will get and build the ChromeOS 3.4 kernel on your Ubuntu install. This is great because now we can compile kernel mods.

The apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) does not work because 3.4.0 seems to be a Google specific build and you cannot just get those headers.

I have added the script here. Just run it as sudo and let it go. When it is done, you will have /usr/src/kernel (this the source and compiled kernel), /usr/src/linux-headers-3.4.0, it also installs this version of the kernel.


... the script ...


Let me know how it works for you. I have compiled and insmod'd kernel modules with this.

Here is how you #include the headers

include </usr/src/linux-headers-3.4.0/include/linux/module.h>
include </usr/src/linux-headers-3.4.0/include/linux/kernel.h>
include </usr/src/linux-headers-3.4.0/include/linux/init.h>
include </usr/src/linux-headers-3.4.0/include/linux/syscalls.h>

//or whatever you need specifically

And I am guessing you already know this but in case someone does not This is the basic makefile for kernel mods. Once you use the script I linked, you can just run make with this makefile and all is well. replace kmod.o with whatever your source.c is called except keep it as .o

Makefile 
obj-m += kmod.o 
all: make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules

clean: make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean

p.s. I had to modify sysinfo.h because the type __kernel_ulong_t was not defined. I changed it to uint64_t. This seems to work just fine. my mods have had no problems thus far. Make sure if you have to do this to edit the sysinfo.h in the 3.4.0 headers

p.p.s. This fixes the issues with vbox and vmware player!!! They just install and work!!
