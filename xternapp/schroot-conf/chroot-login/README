mkjail.sh: makes a tarball containing core shared libraries and the jail's etc/passwd file. 

initjail.sh: unpacks that tarball into the jail, and adds crucial /dev entries, 
             a /proc filesystem, /etc files, core programs like sh, and non-toolchain 
             shared libraries, and appends a given file to the jail's /etc/passwd file. 


1.1. Setting up a jail
here's how to use the scripts to set up a minimal jail containing a copy of the system 
libraries and system /etc/passwd file:

$ sh mkjail.sh / /etc/passwd
$ su
# zcat jail.tar.gz | sh initjail.sh myjail

1.2. Testing the Jail
test it by hand using the /usr/sbin/chroot program to run a shell inside the jail, e.g.

$ su
# /usr/sbin/chroot `pwd`/myjail /bin/sh

(Note: the argument to chroot must be an absolute path, else exec fails. This appears 
to be a bug in Linux.) If you can't run a shell inside the jail, try running something 
easier, e.g. /bin/true (the simplest program there is):

$ su
# /usr/sbin/chroot `pwd`/myjail /bin/true
