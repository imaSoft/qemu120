How to break out of jail

There are well-known techniques used to escape from jail, but the most common 
one requires root privileges inside the jail. The idea is for the program to 
do a chroot to a subdirectory, leaving the current directory outside the jail.

We'll add more notes on ways to break out of a jail - which is meant more to 
show what must be protected against than it is as a how-to for jailbreakers -- 
but we've found a good article on chroot in general here.

    Use mknod to create a raw disk device, thereby doing pretty much 
    anything you like to the system.

    Use mknod to create /dev/mem and modify kernel memory

    Find a carelessly-left hard link that leads outside the jail (though 
    symbolic links don't escape jail, hard links do).

    Use ptrace to trace a process living outside the jail. We may be able 
    to modify this program to do our bad stuff on our behalf.

Almost all jail breaking requires root privileges.
