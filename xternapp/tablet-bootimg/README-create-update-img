[TUTORIAL] Create your own UPDATE.ZIP

This is a guide about the creation of a simple UPDATE.ZIP to flash on your 
Android phone, in recovery mode.

I've created a repository on GITHUB where you can download the "update.zip" 
that we'll use and modify.
(https://github.com/mackief/update.zip--for-Android-Devices-)

So, this is the repository: update.zip--for-Android-Devices-
You can download it as ZIP archive and rename it as update.zip .

So, we have now the most important file, that we're going to modify:

All the apps that you want to insert in the archive and install on the phone, 
must have the .apk estension and you have to put them in /data/app . Then, 
if you want also the app data files, you have to take these files from your 
phone, going with a rooted file manager (i suggest Root_Explorer) to 
/data/data , copying the app folder and pasting it in /data/data of the 
UPDATE.ZIP.

So we have all the apps and datas that we want. Now, we have to write the 
script.

Let's go to META-INF/com/google/android/ and open 'updater-script' with a 
simple text editor.

The only lines that you have to modify are:
Code:

set_perm(1000, 1000, 0644, "/data/app/[PACKAGE].apk");
set_perm_recursive(1000, 1000, 0777, 0777, "/data/data/PACKAGE_DATA_FOLDER");
delete("/data/dalvik-cache/data@app@[PACKAGE].apk@classes.dex");

For each app you have to write these lines. This is an example if you want 
to put ROOT_EXPLORER.APK in the UPDATE.ZIP:

Code:

set_perm(1000, 1000, 0644, "/data/app/ROOT_EXPLORER.APK");
set_perm_recursive(1000, 1000, 0777, 0777, "/data/data/ROOT_EXPLORER_DATA_FOLDER");
delete("/data/dalvik-cache/data@app@ROOT EXPLORER@classes.dex");


That' all. But if you want to delete some apps from your phone, you have to 
write between
Code:

ui_print("| 80%  Installing Applications |");

and
Code:

package_extract_dir("data", "/data");

this line:
Code:

delete("/APK_DIR/APP.APK");

IT'S IMPORTANT TO LEAVE AN EMPTY LINE AT THE END OF THE SCRIPT, OTHERWISE 
THE ZIP WON'T WORK!

You can easily find the name of the app going with Root Explorer to 
/system/app and searching the same app.

If you also want to add your modified Apps, you've to sign them with a 
simple app: Auto-Sign, putting them in /auto-sign/update/app and renaming 
it to Launcher.apk .

You can download AUTO-SIGN from the attachements!

With it you can sign your apks or your zip. So, finally, when you'll finish .
your zip, you'll have to put it in Auto-Sign folder ("/auto-sign").

Then, open Auto-Sign, choose your zip or apk, and click AUTO-SIGN. It will 
create a new apk or zip, name as SIGNED-apk/zip.

Now, you only have to put the update.zip on your sd-card and flash it! Have 
fun guys!
