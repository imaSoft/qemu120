Tablet USB Driver
================
Try this

1. Determine the Hardware Ids for your device (Device Manager, properties, 
details, property)
USB\VID_2207&PID_0000&REV_0222&MI_01
USB\VID_2207&PID_0000&MI_01

2. Add the vendor to adb_usb.ini (C:\Users\username\.android).
In our case, simply type 0x2207, don't copy/paste

3. Add the lines below to android_winusb.inf 
(AndroidSDK\extras\google\usb_driver) for both x86/64bit.

;Nextbook
%SingleAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_2207&PID_0000
%CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_2207&PID_0000&MI_01

Depending on file location, you may have to save as and replace the file 
with admin. permissions. Execute adb kill-server before testing.
