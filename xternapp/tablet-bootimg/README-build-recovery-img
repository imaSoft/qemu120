Build a custom recovery image

To explane how to create a custom recovery will spend so much time, I will 
only give you a brief guide here.

To build a custom recovery, you need to prepare a linux PC.

    You need checkout the android sdk from android offical git repository 
into ~/android/.
    The recovery source code is in the ~/android/bootable/recovery folder, 
you can enter "make recovery" to build your recovery application.
    The output file is in ~/android/out/target/product/generic/system/bin/recovery
    In this step, you need copy the recovery file to your recovery partition 
in your mobile.
(Ref:http://android-dls.com/wiki/index.php?title=HOWTO:_Unpack%2C_Edit%2C_and_Re-Pack_Boot_Images)
        Dump your recovery.img from your mobile.
        Un-pack your recovery.img into ~/recovery folder
        Replace old recovery file in ~/recovery/sbin/recovery with new 
one(~/android/out/target/product/generic/system/bin/recovery), and use 
"chmod a+x ~/recovery/sbin/recovery" command to set file mode.
        Pack your recovery.img 
    Finally, you should switch your mobile to fastboot mode, and use 
"fastboot flash recovery recovery.img" command to flash the new recovery file. 

Beside, the recovery file in the android sdk is very basic example.

To build your recovery you can download Amon RA's Recovery Image, and 
develop recovery image base on his recovery source code.
